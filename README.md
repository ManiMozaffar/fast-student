### Software Requirements:
Imagine you're writing a program for a school. Within the school, there are 4 different user roles:
1. Admin
2. Counselor
3. Teacher
4. Student

Design a student app, where each student has a specific grade. There must be CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionalities for the student object:

1. Admins can perform CRUD operations at the school level.Admins can also expel students.
2. Counselors can only read but have access to the students' information across the entire school.
3. Teachers can perform CRUD operations only in their class. They can't expel (delete) a student from another class they don't teach.
4. Students can only view their own grade. They're not allowed to update, leave, create another student, or view others' grades.

### Technology Requirements:
1. The programming language must be Python.
2. Use JWT and FastAPI or Flask for this task.
3. To simplify and save time, you can skip creating an SQL table and store the data within the application. The table structure and data class must be respected, though.
4. Writing tests is appreciated.
5. Adhering to OOP principles and clean code standards will be valued.
6. Don't spend more than 4 hours on this task. If it takes longer, no worries, but better to keep it within 4 hours. Whenever you're free, put some time into it.
